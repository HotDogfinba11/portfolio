The world of fear of hardware incompatibility and the feeling of dread every time you boot your PC to see the Apple logo, or verbose boot if you want to feel like a hacker man, in hopes to see your login screen. <br/><br/> I began once my Gen 4 NVMe arrived for me to insert into my motherboard; I was off to the races! I recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGWJhSQZWZw" target="_blank"><mark>tutorial</mark></a> if you are using a Ryzen or recent AMD CPU. His EFI is included, however, I strongly recommend creating a personal EFI for better system stability - the holy crux of a Hackintosh. For a text-based tutorial, I default to <a href="https://vanilla.amd-osx.com/" target="_blank"><mark>vanilla.amd-osx.</mark></a> <br/> <br/> So, 30mins had passed with my install USB setup (saviour of fast internet and yes, vanilla) with OpenCore as my bootloader which certainly requires more technical know-how to setup. However, for us mear mortals <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree"><mark>ProperTree</mark></a> is a godsend. Now here comes the fun part, boot up the install and cross your fingers to get life (may luck be on your side). Amazingly, it booted the first time and I was greeted with the graphical install screen. A few seconds later once formatted and partitioned, its the step to install macOS (Catalina in my case due to my purchase of a GT 710). Thankfully this all went smoothly - I would like to think crossing my fingers helped - I was fully booted into macOS Catalina with networking and hardware-accelerated graphics as hoped.<br/><br/>All to do now was to copy the EFI partition with OpenCore over to the internal NVMe drive to allow for the PC to boot without the USB required to be plugged into the tower; I have however kept the install USB as a backup for if anything goes wrong. I am now a very happy user of a Ryzen based Hackintosh with even iMessage support. The install has also successfully upgraded from 10.15.2 -> 10.15.3 without any intervention (thanks Apple for making it so simple haha).<br/></p><h4>System Specs</h4><ul><li>Ryzen 7 3700x @ 4.3GHz 1.275V</li><li>16GB DDR4 3333MHz RAM</li><li>MSI x570-A Pro Motherboard</li><li>FE GTX 1080 8GB</li><li>GT 710 1GB</li><li>1TB Gen 4 NVMe M.2 SSD</li><li>4TB HDD</li></ul><h4>End result</h4><a style="width: 70%" href="../Images/Full/Screenshot.jpg" class="progressive replace shadow"><img src="../Images/Lazy/Screenshot.jpg" class="preview" alt="macOS Desktop"></a><div class="actions" style="padding-top: 10px"> <a class="button" style="visibility: hidden"> </a> <a style="float: right;" class="button" href="arch.html"> Next &raquo; </a></div></div> </section></div><a href="#main" id="to-top" title="Go to top">back to top</a> <script src="../dark.js"></script> </body></html>
