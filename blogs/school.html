<p><p>Light Hall<img src="../Images/Light-Hall.png" style="width:20px">. What a rollercoaster you ended up being. Charity football match, sport days, best school mom (we all know who), friendships made, conkers, trips abroad. All of us experiencing a unique journey through it all - to all have it end together on Thursday 19th March 2020.
<br/><br/> Lets go back to the beginning - first day of school - all the way back in 2015, isn`t it crazy how quickly time passes you by! Year 7, the start of it all, walking through those school gates for the first time. New uniform, new buildings, new location, new peers, new teachers - hitting us in one go. I`m sure we can all remember that first day and look upon it fondly and with great reminiscence. Let me put you back into your mind from 5 years ago; feeling small within the big groups of year 11s (they aren`t so scary after allðŸ˜…) and not knowing the difference between Churchill and Ghandi, I am sure we all nearly did or did find ourselves in the wrong lesson atleast once (bit embarrasing if I`m alone on this oneðŸ˜‚). Mr Razzle Dazzle (genuinely does anyone remember his actual name), oh how we loved to have you as a cover with your crooked mouth and inability to control the class even in the best of times. I remember the excitement even now of classes cheering to have you - atleast while it lasted until year 8 (was a sad day for us all when you told us you were leaving). This is for anyone who had the pleasure of being taught by Mrs Wilkes, I say taught, it was more like an hour of her stories which I can assure back in year 7 set 1 H band took full advantage of. I don`t remember many of them but one about a donkey (they really were this random) has always been one that has stuck in my mind. There were plenty about her husband too, and she definitely made me question if she had actually had any other job than a teacher at Light Hall.
<br/><br/> Okay so this brings us to year 8, an emotional one to say to least. I am sure I don`t need to mention his name but a fellow peer and friend Harrison was diagnosed with Leukaemie, I remember greatly how distraught everyone in our year was when they heard of the news - it was even greater for his close friends - was a difficult night to get through when he told me. However, it started the idea of a charity football match, months of planning and organising later by Jack B and Jamie B (sorry if I forget others) the match was one and what a great game to have the honour to take part in. I don`t think we can thank Mrs o'Brien enough for how supportive she had been through it all (she definitely came into her roll of being school mom) to make this possible - I don`t think it would have been possible without her. We were able to proudly present Â£420 to Cure Leukaemia charity with the donations from people who attended.</p>

<br/><br/><p> While I am aiming to mention learning in this, year 8 was also the year we took our options, deciding what lessons we had the most passion for. An important moment for us all as we had to sit through a total of (hours counted) of these lessons.
            
<br/><br/>**I kept this as relatable as possible for everyone to read and understand, and I am going to miss all my peers; however I need to take this moment to show my appreciation for Mrs o'Brien, Mrs Lawrence, Mrs Snell and especially to Mr Duffy who has become not only my teacher and mentor but a friend that I can`t thank enough for what opportunities and support he has given me throughout school.<br/><br/> Love from, Oliver**</p>
